# Project_BST
 Binary Search Tree in C++ 

About the project
-----------------
I programmed a Binary Search Tree (BST) class and driver to store and retrieve data with dynamic memory. I used a .h header file and .cpp implementation file for reusability and encapsulation. 

Details
-------
The class uses dynamically allocated nodes with pointers to the left and right children for storage flexibility. In the driver program, I generated random unsigned integers on a .txt file so I could test expected results from printing functions (preorder, postorder, inorder, ancestors, etc.). The main() function reads in these values and inserts them to the BST object, and the rest of the program tests the functions.
